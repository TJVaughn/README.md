*Howdy*
The internet taught me how to code so now I'm doing it's bidding with NodeJS and React. 
I like to build things and learn. I like working on things that are meaningful to me, things that propel the world in a good direction, things that help people and solve problems.
Ultimately solving problems for people, and giving them more value than the cost is what motivates me.
